# Wuzzaf Job Posts Exploratory Analysis
Explore jobs and job seekers applications on WUZZUF from 2014 to 2016.<br>

## Project Description 
In the dynamic world of online job marketplaces, achieving a harmonious equilibrium between job supply and demand is an enduring challenge. At WUZZUF, our primary goal is to optimize the platform for demand, relevance, and quality. We facilitate connections between employers and prospective applicants, and curate relevant job recommendations for job seekers.

To gain deeper insights into this complex ecosystem, we are embarking on a data-driven project. We will be analyzing a dataset derived from WUZZUF, which spans the years 2014 to 2016, focusing on job posts and their corresponding applications.

It is important to note that while the majority of jobs are centered in Egypt, the dataset also encompasses positions from other locations.<br>
